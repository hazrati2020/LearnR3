## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
NHANES_small<- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes_smaall.csv"))
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
NHANES_small

NHANES_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(Diabetes)) %>%
  group_by(Diabetes, Education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # 2. Round the means to 1 digit and
  # modify the `education` column so that male and female get capitalized.
  mutate(
    mean_age = round(mean_age, 1),
    mean_bmi = round(mean_bmi, 1),
    education = str_to_sentence(Education)
  ) %>%
  # 3. Rename `diabetes` to `"Diabetes Status"` and `education` to `Education`
  rename(
    "Diabetes Status" = Diabetes, 
    "Education" = Education,
    "Mean Age" = mean_age, 
    "Mean BMI" = mean_bmi
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and BMI for each education and diabetes status.")

```
